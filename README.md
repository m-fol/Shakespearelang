# A Quick Guide to Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL)
The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is an esoteric programming language, emulating Shakespearean plays.

## Installation

This programming language can be installed in any compiler that supports Python.
Simply, through cmd (Windows), run the command:
```
pip install shakespearelang
```

Make sure that if you are using PyCharm, to install the library through the compiler:
> You will have to go to File -> New Project Setup -> Settings for new Projects.

Install and import the library there, searching it by its name.

## Starting the Program
For a valid SPL, a title is always needed.
```
Play Title, Description
```
The description of the play is marked as a comment and ignored.
## Setting Variables
Variables are named after Shakespearian characters.
```
Name, Description
```
Likewise, the description is always ignored.

## Acts and Scenes

## Entering, exiting and "exeunting" (is that a word?) Variables

## Incrementing and Reducting

## Looping (with if-goto)

## Setting values

## Calculations
### Sum and Difference
### Square root
### Div

## Input and Output

## Pushing and Pulling in Characters' Stacks
In this programming language, each character is considered a stack.
